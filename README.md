## Taskinator is a web interface that was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

This web interface allows the user to create/edit/delete tasks and organize them in three columns by status.

The three status columns are: To-Do, In Progress, and Completed. 

Taskinator also features the drag-and-drop ability by allowing the user to click and drag the tasks into different category columns. The user can also utilize the drop down list options to change the statuses.
